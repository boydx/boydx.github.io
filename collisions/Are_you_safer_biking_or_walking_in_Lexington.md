2014 analysis

Are you safer biking or walking in Lexington? Let's assume that safe walking or biking is not colliding with an automobile. Then let's assume that Kentucky collects the most accurate data for collisions between automobiles and bicyclists or pedestrians. 

During the time frame of our study, 1,978 collisions happened between a car and a pedestrian, while 896 collisions happened between a car and a bicyclist. That's a collision ratio of 2.2 pedestrians to 1 bicyclist. We know that there are far more walkers than bikers, so this ratio suggests that walking is safer. 

Well, this is trivial observation until you look at the results of collisions. Pedestrians have it worse. They are more likely to have injuries, fatalities, and be the result of hit and run cases. The implication is the we need to focus on building safe modes of travel for pedestrians. Cyclists win too, because it's easy to accommodate their use on a pedestrian network.
