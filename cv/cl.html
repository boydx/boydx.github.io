<p>UW-Madison Geography:</p>

<p>I attended my first (out of state) NACIS conference in Madison and I was very impressed with the mapping program. Since that conference I have discovered many talented and inspirational mappers/cartographers/programmers have came through the UW-Madison Geography. That energy is amazing and I would like to be part of it.</p>

<p>How can I help? I have made maps for decades as a freelance cartographer and instructor. Over the past two years I have taught and help build an online graduate certificate in open source mapping at the University of Kentucky. The courses you need fulfilled are within the scope I have taught and my resume should provide examples.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or would like more examples, please free to ask.</p>

<p>Kind Regards,</p>
