University of Kentucky Geography:

I taught my first class in Geography in Fall 2008. Since then, I have worked in various capacities and achieved notable recognition. In 2014, I received the "Outstanding Geography Teacher Award" as selected by the committee of Geography Majors. With the opportunity to fully engage the department, I am committed to making UKy Geography a dynamic, imaginative, and distinguished institution at which to learn mapping and GIS.

How can I help? As a freelance cartographer and an instructor, I have made maps that inspire students. Over the past two years, I have taught and helped build an online graduate certificate in open source mapping at New Maps Plus. My teaching style is best described as hands-on, Kentucky-focused, enthusiastic, and creative. While lesson preparation grants me opportunities for continual exploration, I never forget that my primary responsibility is to help students grow and learn in a positive way.

If you have any questions or would like more examples, feel free to ask.

Kind Regards,

Boyd Shearer
