# Diversity and inclusion statement

I define *diversity* as recognizing that beliefs, values, experiences, and abilities are different among people. I define *inclusion* as encouraging the expression of diversity while establishing that no point of difference takes priority over another. In the classroom, students should feel inspired to express points of view without punitive repercussions.

My personal history informs this statement. When I was younger, I was harassed because of a speech disorder. Because of this experience, I am sensitive to the anxiety that students can have when they feel different. All students must feel safe and welcome in the classroom free from harassment and discrimination of any kind. If a student submits a letter of accommodation, I ask them to guide me to enable them to succeed. 

Sometimes circumstances outside of class make it difficult for students to attend class and succeed, but these circumstances would not meet the threshold for excusable absences. Leveraging my online teaching experience, I create online video lectures for all classes. If students have to miss a few consecutive classes, they can still complete coursework. To help with students' finances, my classes do not require any software or material purchases. 

In each course syllabus, I try to provide information to help overcome the myriad of challenges that students face and help students understand that they are part of a larger community. In addition to the Policy on non-discrimination, I give a list of Campus resources that could support a student through a crisis.
