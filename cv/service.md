# Service Portfolio

## GIS and Mapping Minor web page

In support of the Minor, I have created a repository that showcases the courses offered and a selected list of student achievements. This ongoing project will hopefully collect works from other courses and teachers for promotion. [EXHIBIT C - Web page PDF (https://uky-gis.github.io/)]

## Contributing support to the External Relations Committee

The committee asked me to create materials to support the 75th Anniversary of the department, principally doing archival research for photographs, maps, and other materials to promote the event. Because Karl Raitz is the keynote speaker for the Simple Day event, I have prioritized locating historic aerial photographs of campus and Kentucky landscapes that compliment the photography he made for the 1998 Kentucky Atlas.

## Member of the ad hoc Digital Technologies Committee

I have contributed to committee discussions about existing courses and brainstorming new courses. In a more focused capacity I am working with Nick Lally to help standardize the core proficiencies desired in GEO 309. 

North American Cartographic Information Society annual conference

In October, I represented New Maps Plus by networking and handing out our new brochures announcing the Masterâ€™s degree program. I met with one graduate to the New Maps Program and advocated that the conference should be held Lexington, as it was in 1997, in discussions with the NACIS president. (Photos from conference)
