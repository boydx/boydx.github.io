## Courses taughtc (July 2018 - June 2019)

The courses taught during this period include MAP 671, MAP 672, and GEO 409. Each course was taught twice.

The entirely online MAP courses require good lesson documentation to successfully guide students to complete assignments outside of a traditional classroom environment. I continue writing new lessons and recording videos to keep documentation up-to-date in the fast pace of evolution in open source technology. Over the past year I have created 12 new videos for MAP 671 and 5 videos for MAP 672 (and 10 for GEO 409).  [EXHIBIT A - Examples of instructional videos created]. 

MAP 671 offered a unique and difficult challenge. This course is now mostly taught by adjunct instructors and I rewrote the lessons . An important change was making lessons more "elastic" for the variety of student skill levels. Most lessons now have optional advanced topics.

My GEO 409 course is a traditional classroom course filled mostly with students who are close to graduating and thinking of employment using their new GIS and mapping skills. I have structured the course to help make these students competitive after graduation. We learn analysis skills on enterprise GIS software, work with the latest data, and make unique and exploratory visualizations. I try to inspire students to consider that they are creating genuinely new and consequential material; every map and small statistic are found gems. This semester I have written 7 new lessons.

## Philosophy

* One of my guiding principles in teaching (and I remind myself of this before entering each classroom) is that the time in class is not about me but the student. This simple thought helps me focus on my responsibilities to provide proper instruction to all students.

* I believe in intervention to help students succeed. If a student is struggling, I will reach out and try to schedule time outside of class to help when they cannot access office hours. If we cannot meet in person, I use the screen-sharing platform Zoom to meet remotely. 

* For mapping exercises, I promote mapping where we live. As data becomes more abundant, we need a critical awareness of its veracity and utility. Mapping what we know is a powerful filter to understand new data.

* Another core principal is fostering student creativity in their mapping projects. While observing and respecting traditional cartographic practices, students should feel inspired to experiment with their design choices. 

* New technology and teaching platforms shouldnâ€™t be isolated. I explore how I can successfully blend the teaching techniques used in GEO (traditional) and MAP (online) courses to better serve students.
